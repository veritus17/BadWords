# **BadWords – Cleaner Timelines, Faster.**

Automatically detect and/or remove **bad takes**, **silence**, and **filler words** in DaVinci Resolve using OpenAI Whisper. Designed specifically for **Linux**.

### **🐧 Linux SIMPLE Setup Instructions Down Below**

**💡 Other OS versions coming soon\!** 

## **🚀 Features**

* **Smart Detection** — Finds filler words (umm, ahh), silence, and repeated sentences using AI.  
* **DaVinci Integrated** — Runs directly inside Resolve as a Workflow Script.  
* **Safe & Clean** — Uses pipx for an isolated environment, keeping your system packages clean.  
* **GPU Accelerated** — Utilizes your GPU for fast transcription (via Torch/CUDA/ROCm).  
* **Interactive Review** — Review cuts before applying them to the timeline.

## **⭐ Core Capabilities**

* **Filler Word Removal**: Auto-cut "yyy", "eee", "umm" and custom words.  
* **Silence Removal**: Detects silence based on dB threshold.  
* **Script Comparison**: Paste your script to find deviations or missing lines.  
* **Non-Destructive**: Creates a new timeline with cuts, preserving your original edit.
